## Overview
This project gave me more practice with JavaScript and React. I recently covered functional components and hooks and I wanted to build a project that included both of them. The game is quite simple: the user is presented with three hex values and the goal is to click on the hex value that corresponds to the background color. Every time the user chooses the correct color the number of correct guesses will increase.

## Future Improvements
The intended user for this game is someone who wants to improve their knowledge of CSS styling. So maybe one day I will add ways to test other CSS properties (i.e. a game to guess the length of a line in pixels or a version of this game that uses RGB values).
